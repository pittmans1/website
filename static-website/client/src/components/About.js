I joined with a dream and a way of thinking, I wanted to change the world. I learned many things in my experience with the Air Force first and foremost is that life is short and we all deserve the pursuit of happiness never degrade anyone above or below us. I live to these words I will always stand up for those who need help. Now, let us segway into why I became a developer, that reason is simple I can change the world from behind the screens (see what I did there?). I always had an interest in coding and how the internet works just about technology, in general, I always loved asking the question of how or why I want to learn everything I can. I want to follow my dreams and build applications to change people’s lives even if it’s in the smallest way. They say sometimes the smallest influence can have the biggest impact.   </p>
